# ðŸŽ± Ball Pool Simulator

An interactive Java-based simulator that mimics the behavior of a ball pool using custom physics logic. Built with a modular design that separates simulation logic, visuals, and utilities, this application allows easy extension of motion behavior such as simple, frictional, or accelerated movement.
